# GitPusher
GitPusher is a simple shell script that allows you to push your code to GitHub in 1 command rather than 4 on Mac OSX, Ubuntu and the Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows 10 onwards.<br>

For the Ubuntu version, ```xclip``` needs to be installed. The command to install ```xclip``` via terminal is as follows:
```sudo apt-get install xclip```
